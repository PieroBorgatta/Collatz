Phantom-word definitions for the Lean formalization of the Collatz
shadowing lemma.

This file starts the second half of Phase 2 of `TODO.md`: the data type
`PhantomWord` that names a finite Syracuse `ν₂`-word
`w = (a_0, ..., a_{L-1})`. Subsequent tasks (2.5–2.8) will add the
affine map `S_w`, the constants `C_w`/`A_w`, the rational fixed point
`q_w`, and the periodic partial sums `B_m` on top of this scaffolding.

## Phantom words

Paper Section 3, "Phantom words and their rational fixed points":

```text
w = (a_0, a_1, ..., a_{L-1}) ∈ ℕ^L,   A(w) := Σ a_i.
```

The paper requires the word to be nonempty (length `L ≥ 1`) and each
entry to be a positive natural (each `a_i` is the `ν₂` exponent of some
`3·n + 1`, hence `a_i ≥ 1`). We carry both constraints as structure
fields so that downstream definitions can use them without re-proving.
-/

/--
A **phantom word** is a finite, nonempty sequence of positive natural
numbers, intended to represent the `ν₂` word `(a_0, ..., a_{L-1})` of
one period of an expansive Syracuse cycle.

## Affine coefficients of `S_w` (paper eq. (3.1))

Composing `L` Syracuse steps with `ν₂`-word `(a_0, ..., a_{L-1})` gives
the affine map

```text
S_w(n) = (3^L · n + C_w) / 2^A_w,
```

where `C_w` and `A_w := A(w)` satisfy the recursion

```text
C_0 = 0,           A_0 = 0,
C_{j+1} = 3·C_j + 2^{A_j},
A_{j+1} = A_j + a_j.
```

We capture this recursion as a left fold over `w.vals` of the
state pair `(C_j, A_j)`. The right component of the final state equals
`PhantomWord.A` (the running sum of the word).
-/

/--
Single step of the `(C_j, A_j)` recursion of paper eq. (3.1).

Given the current pair `(C_j, A_j)` and the next word entry `a_j`,
returns `(C_{j+1}, A_{j+1}) = (3·C_j + 2^{A_j}, A_j + a_j)`.

the running second coordinate of `affineCoeffs` is the partial sum of

## Periodic extension and partial sums

For the Lemma 3.1 statement we need to talk about the `j`-th entry of
the periodic word `w^∞ = (a_0, a_1, …, a_{L-1}, a_0, a_1, …)` and its
running partial sum `B_m = Σ_{i=0}^{m-1} a_{i mod L}` (paper Section 3,
just before Lemma 3.1).
-/

/-- The `j`-th entry of the periodic extension `w^∞`, given by indexing
into `w.vals` with `j mod L`. Out-of-bounds is impossible for an actual
`PhantomWord` since `L ≥ 1`; the explicit `0` default keeps the
function total without a side-condition. -/
def aAt (w : PhantomWord) (j : ℕ) : ℕ :=
  w.vals.getD (j % w.length) 0

/-- Periodic partial sum `B_m := Σ_{i=0}^{m-1} a_{i mod L}` (paper
Section 3), expressed literally as the sum of the first `m` entries of
the periodic word. The closed form
`(m / L) · A + sum (take (m mod L) w.vals)` is recoverable as a separate
theorem when needed; the sum form makes the induction lemma `B_succ`
(used by Lemma 3.1) trivial. -/

## Affine Syracuse map `S_w`

The map `S_w(x) := (3^L · x + C_w) / 2^A_w` lands in `ℚ_[2]`, not in
`ℤ_[2]`, because `2` is not a unit in `ℤ_[2]`. The Open-Gaps note in
`INVENTORY.md` recommends exactly this typing: keep affine maps in
`ℚ_[2]`, and reserve `ℤ_[2]` for the residue/congruence statements.

For the phantom orbit (when `x = q_w`) the value is in fact a `ℤ_[2]`
integer, but proving that is part of Phase 3.

## Rational and `2`-adic fixed points `q_w`

Paper eq. (3.2):
```text
q_w = C_w / (2^A_w - 3^L).
```
Computed in `ℚ` so that the (signed) subtraction makes sense; `ℕ`
truncated subtraction would be wrong for expansive phantoms where
`3^L > 2^A_w`. The lifting to `ℤ_[2]` requires the rational to have
odd denominator, which is true for any nontrivial phantom (since
`2^A_w - 3^L` is odd) but proving it in normalised `ℚ.den` form is
deferred to Phase 3 — see `qwRat_den_odd` placeholder below.

For the length-1 phantom `[1]`, the affine map collapses to the usual
single-step Syracuse formula `(3·x + 1) / 2` inside `ℚ_[2]`. This is
the algebraic version of the acceptance criterion in Task 2.5; the
identification with the natural-number iterate `S` on odd inputs is
left to a later phase (it requires `ν₂(3n+1) = 1` and a Padic cast).
